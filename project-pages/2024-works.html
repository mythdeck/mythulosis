As a young adult in minority groups, I must recognize self-care in the form of communication as a necessity. It is not achievable for myself to be explicit in my needs through words alone. Painting is my form of outspoken advocacy by my own hands.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I refuse to depict anything but the coexistence of bitterness and beauty in my work that my words would not quite articulate. The humanity in speechlessness and the vagueness of my values are urged into the physical and digestible by what takes place within the painted worlds. I place the viewer in a spot to uncover their own views and interpretations from mine.</div>
